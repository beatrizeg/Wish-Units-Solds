# Product Sales Prediction
The motivation of this project is to complete the task of the course in Data Science: Capstone from HarvardX, course PH125.9x, under the Choose your own! project submission.

The project aims to predict the units sold for each specific product. The database was downloaded from Kaggle and consists of data from e-commerce platform Wish. Wish is a retailer that sells millions of product to customers in a e-commerce marketplace. The data consists of the products under the tag “summer” showed during August 2020.
We want to see which features can predict the units that will be sold in a specific product, and the accuracy that we get under the different machine learning algorithms.
